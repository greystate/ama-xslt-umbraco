# Ask Me Anything About XSLT in Umbraco

Today (March 14th, 2016 - Ï€ day, right?!) I discovered that the [XSLT forum](https://our.umbraco.org/forum/developers/xslt/)
(and probably others as well) on [Our Umbraco](https://our.umbraco.org/) had been switched to read-only mode.

While that's great and awesome for the "noise" level on Our Umbraco, I just wanted to provide a place for those
who are still on an earlier version of Umbraco that's been built with XSLT macros and are not able (or willing)
to upgrade any time soon.

Or you may just have inherited an old site, which doesn't make sense to upgrade but the client *needs* to
have this thing changed and you see this thing called *apply-templates* and have no clue as to what that
means, and how do you make it do what the client wants?

Create an issue here and we'll try to help you.
